// Extend the Vehicle class from the previous task to include a method move() that returns "The vehicle is moving". Then, override the move() method in the Car class to return "The car is driving".

// Add a static method isVehicle(obj) to the Vehicle class that checks if a given object is an instance of Vehicle. The method should return true if the object is a Vehicle or a subclass of Vehicle, and false otherwise.
